## <a name="deployment-link"></a> 2. Deployment link

## <a name="installation"></a> 3. Installation

No installations are required to run this game. The only tools needed are a web browser with JavaScript support and internet connectivity.

## <a name="technologies"></a> 4. Technologies Used

This game was written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Additional tools used:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode): code editor used for writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Live Server: an extension that enables you to launch a local development server with live browser reload capability.
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
- Google Chrome Web Browser: used for launching the website and displaying the application
  - Google Chrome Developer Tools: For troubleshooting and debugging
- Git/GitHub (for version control) and Github pages(for deployment)

## <a name="deliverables"></a> 5. Deliverables

- A working game hosted online
- A git repository hosted on Github, including:
  - a link to the hosted game
  - frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- The Simon game should:
  - Render a game board in the browser
  - include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
  - adhere to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
  - use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
  - use semantic markup for HTML and CSS while adhering to best practices
  - write code that is well-formatted and well-commented

### Potential Extra Features

- keeping track of multiple game rounds including wins, losses and draws
- strict mode
- use localStorage to persist data locally
- include audio
- fully responsive site
- inventive styling (e.g. hover effects, animations)

### User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new Simon game.
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page.

## <a name="planning"></a>6. Planning

## Bronze Plan: MVP (Minimum viable product)

- make a Simon game that works with the following features:

  - code that follows KISS/DRY principles
  - separate files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - use semantic markup when writing HTML and CSS and use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
  - code has comments explaining logic and adequate formatting

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)
- https://www.ultraboardgames.com/simon/game-rules.php

- button that enables the user to start a game
- button allowing players to to reset the game without refreshing the page
- host project online

## Silver Plan

- keep track of wins and losses
- display wins and losses on a score board
- enable users to reset scores
- make game look more polished with CSS features
- display a message telling players whose turn it is to play in the colour they selected
- add sounds effects
- add animation effects
- enable user to mute sound effects

## Gold Plan

- 2 players
- use localStorage to save game data locally and enable players to continue where they left off after the page refreshes or the internet connection is interrupted
- make the web page fully responsive so that it can be used from a smartphone or smaller screen

After lining out my bronze, silver and gold plans, I created a wireframe:

This was a solo project.

### Day 1 - 19/01/2024

After I had my MVP/bronze plan, wireframe and pseudocode laid out, I took the first few steps toward building the project:

- I created a repository on GitHub for the project.
- I connected the gihub repository to a directory on my local machine.
- I created new HTML/CSS/JavaScript files in it.
- I connected the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file and made sure they work
